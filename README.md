# Prev5Home (Prevent Home Scammers)
The goal of the project is to prevent spammers from creating fake home listing online and creating trouble for renters and rentees.
The program will fetch results from online and catch spammer's ads. The program will filter out specific sites that appear suspicious.
The program will then attempt to email or contact the user of potential sites with malicious content for the user to take action.

The program is designed to run 24/7 on a server in order to fetch results every once in a while.
